# TIC TAC TOE GAME

Text-Based Terminal Game
Built with Python from scratch

## How the Game Works

You take turns playing either against another player or computer.
The Computer makes random decisions, currently very easy to beat.

The board is displayed as so in the terminal.

| A1 | A2 | A3 |
| B1 | B2 | B3 |
| C1 | C2 | C3 |

From here you enter which coordinate square to occupy.
Player 1 is always X
And the other one is always O.
Scores are recorded.
